They are mammals, but they lay eggs. They are often classified as long- or sort-beaked, but don't have beaks at all, in the traditional sense; they have fleshy noses that can be either on the long side or rather short. They don't really look like true anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), either, and they are not closely related to them. They are spiny, though; their bodies are covered with hollow, barbless quills.

They are strong swimmers and can move quickly on both land and water. Cassowaries are shy and they are usually hard to spot, at least in their natural rain forest habitats. They are not overly aggressive, and attacks are rare. But they can do a lot of damage if they are provoked or angered.

            <p>Our popular zoo has recently got some new residents! We are happy to welcome a range of Australian species such as the ${mammalArray[0]}, the ${reptileArray[0]} and the ${birdArray[0]}.</p>
            <p>They will stay with us as long as they need some extra care before being released back into the nature that is their beloved home.</p>
            <p>Check out the brief summary of all of our new friends in the menu on the left. For the enthusiastic animal nerd there is even more to read if you go to the detalied animal pages found in the menu above. And of course we hope you visit us to say hi to our new friends.</p>
